# Staying Sharp Over Winter Break 

One key thing to remember in general is that you get out of this course whatever you put into it. This cohort is in a unique position to have an extended winter break right in the beginning of the course, and it is up to you how you use this time. It's a great time to review topics you were confused on, really solidify the JavaScript basics before we start moving on, and just learn how to stay motivated on your own like you'll have to be after graduation. 

We've gone ahead and gathered some tips from other instructors on how to use this time wisely, as well as put together a bunch of activities and links to resources that you can use to stay sharp while we have no class. 

## Suggestions and Tips for Staying Motivated 

- Make a list of goals and prioritize what is most important to you and for you to succeed as the course continues
- Figure out how much time you realistically will have time and want to spend, then make a modest plan 
  - e.g. schedule 1 hour a day or so, don't overdo it! It's better to do a little bit than to overwhelm yourself and do none of it at all
- Remember you are on your own, but you are not alone
  - Schedule zoom rooms and work together with your fellow classmates on something
  - Talk to each other on what you are working on and try doing one thing on your own and one thing someone else is excited about and then compare how you approached it/solved it/what you learned
- There will be 4 scheduled office hours with some of the instructors, try and visit all the hours that you can! This is a great time to get any lingering questions answered

 ### Solidify your JS Fundamentals and Logical Thinking
  - If you're the type to learn by reading,  try reading the first 1-6 Chapters of [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
    - Additionally, try the problems at the back of each chapter
  - Go back to labs, homework problems, challenges, or any extra bonuses you didn't have time to solve and try them again 
  - Try the free [coderbyte challenges](https://coderbyte.com/challenges)
  - Try out [project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
  - Sign up for [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) or [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) if you haven't already and try some problems out 
  - Check out all the resources your fellow students have shared in tech-talk! 
  - Try out the following activities: 
    - [Landscaper](javascript/landscaper.md)
    - [Hangman](javascript/hangman.md)
    - [Space Battle](javascript/space-battle.md)
