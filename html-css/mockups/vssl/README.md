# VSSL Mockup + Wireframing

## Brief Intro to Wireframing

A website [wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.  The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the website’s content, including interface elements and navigational systems, and how they work together.

The wireframe usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus lies in functionality, behavior, and priority of content. In other words, it focuses on what a screen does, not what it looks like.

You can do wireframing [online](https://wireframe.cc/) or [by hand](./wireframe_byhand.jpg).

## Getting Started

1. If you haven't alerady, fork and clone the `winter-break` repo then cd into this vssl directory
1. From the `vssl` directory, there's a `vssl_mockup` directory that has the images you'll need in an `img` directory. `cd` into it
3. Inside the `vssl_mockup` folder, create an `index.html` file.  Make sure you're creating it on the same level as the `img` folder and `mockup.png`.  
4. Add the boilerplate to your html file.

## Re-create the mockup for VSSL

1. Before you begin, take a look at the mockup and think about what tags you'll need and how you'll need to organize the HTML. 
1. Then, try to recreate the mockup! We suggest trying to lay out all your HTML first before you do any CSS! 

### Notes 

1. Images - You have been provided with all of the images that you need to create this mockup in the `vssl_mockup/img` folder. Take a look at what you have before you begin.  Think about the relative path for your images when creating them in an `<img>` tag.
1. Text - Feel free to use `lorem` in place of the real text.
