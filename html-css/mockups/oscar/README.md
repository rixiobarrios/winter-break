    2. [On display](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjSe_K3agYc&index=7&list=PLdnONIhPScST0Vy4LrIZiYKpFNoxgyH7J)

    4. [On responsive design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsuCBmzLf_U&index=21&list=PLdnONIhPScST0Vy4LrIZiYKpFNoxgyH7J)

    5. [On units of measure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5axuSSBIMuQ&index=9&list=PLdnONIhPScST0Vy4LrIZiYKpFNoxgyH7J)

1. Then, inside this `oscar` folder, create `index.html` and `styles.css` files. Work in those files to mockup the following:

## Deliverables

`index.html` and `styles.css` files that try to recreate the Oscar mockup as best as you can. A few notes:

1. The images are in the `images` directory inside this oscar folder, except for the header. For that, just use a solid color background or use whatever image you like.
1. Don't worry about icons like facebook, twitter, youtube, instagram. As a stretch, use the inspector to see what they did and try to copy it.
1. Don't worry about matching the fonts the site uses. Just use `font-family: Arial` or `font-family: Times New Roman` or whatever you like.
1. Don't worry about rounded corners of buttons. If you can figure it out, great!
1. It's fine to guess at the colors
1. **The main thing we want you to focus on is the positioning/layout!**
