# Simple Blog Mockup 

### Getting Started 

1. Create a `simple-blog` directory
1. `cd` into the directory and create `styles.css` and `index.html` files
1. Work in these files to complete the activity below!

### The Activity 

Look at the image below and create this webpage using HTML and CSS.

#### NOTE: Plan before you code!

Take a few minutes to describe to yourself what you see and figure out what tags you'll likely need.

### The Resources 

1. URL for image: https://imgur.com/NzdTHeo.png
    - NOTE: This image is large! You'll have to resize it using CSS later on
 
1. **Don't worry about matching the colors/fonts exactly,** but in case you do want to try: 
     - The fonts were found on [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
     - Consider using a color picker to find the hex codes used in the mockup!
        - Macbooks come with an app called Digital Color Meter that you can use, or you can find a color picker online through google

1. For text to fill the paragraphs, there are a few ways to do this:
     - in your `.html` file type `lorem` and press tab to get some auto generated text by atom.
     - use [a standard Lorem Ipsum generator](http://www.lipsum.com/)
     - want more flavor? Choose one from [this list](http://meettheipsums.com/)
     - explore even more and practice your google-fu

1. The links that you create do not have to go anywhere, but you should be able to click on them.
    - Reminder!: Use a `#` to make a "dummy" link.
